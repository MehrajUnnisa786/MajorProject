It leads to dark, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and bolls, which later turn brown and necrotic. Severe infections can cause defoliation, stunted growth, and reduced yield."

It causes upward curling and distortion of leaves, along with vein thickening and stunted plant growth. Infected plants produce fewer bolls, leading to a significant loss in fiber yield."

The disease results in wilting, yellowing, and premature leaf drop, eventually leading to plant death. It spreads through contaminated soil, water, and plant debris."
